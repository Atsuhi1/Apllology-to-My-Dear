Dear Shiwani,<br><br>

I know I've let you down.  
In trying to hold on to you, I forgot to hold myself up ‚Äî and in the process, I made you carry more than you ever should have.  
For that, I am deeply, achingly sorry.<br><br>

You were my calm when my mind was in chaos, my anchor when I drifted too far ‚Äî and instead of cherishing you, I clung too tightly.  
You didn‚Äôt deserve to feel overwhelmed, unheard, or burdened.  
You deserved peace, laughter, and someone who lifted your spirit.  
And for not being that person... I carry a weight of regret.<br><br>

But Shiwani, I am growing. Not just for you ‚Äî for us.  
I want to become someone you can turn to with ease, not caution.  
Someone who brings light into your day, not shadows of guilt or worry.<br><br>

Thank you for your patience, your kindness, and your love ‚Äî even when I didn‚Äôt make it easy to give.  
If I could take back the heaviness I caused, I would a thousand times.  
But all I can do now is promise: I‚Äôm becoming better.  
For you. For us. For love that deserves more.<br><br>

With all my heart,<br>
<strong>Arnav ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong>
</p>
